        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A curry is a dish with a sauce seasoned with spices, mainly associated with South Asian cuisine.
            In southern India, leaves from the curry tree may be included. There are many varieties of curry.
            The choice of spices for each dish in traditional cuisine depends on regional cultural tradition and
            personal preferences.</p>

                the chicken and potatoes are cooked.</li>
