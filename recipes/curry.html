    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A curry is a dish with a sauce seasoned with spices, mainly associated with South Asian cuisine.

        The choice of spices for each dish in traditional cuisine depends on regional cultural tradition and
        personal preferences.</p>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sauté.</strong> Grab a skillet or a large pot and get your onions going first over medium heat until nice and fragrant.
            Then, toss in your chicken and curry paste and let that do it’s thing. Finally, toss the potatoes in there.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer.</strong> Pour that luscious coconut cream in there with a bit of water and let it simmer away until
            the chicken and potatoes are cooked.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir.</strong> Add in a little splish splash of fish sauce and a sprinkle of brown sugar to really make it sing.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve.</strong>On a pile of steamy rice. Fall in love forever.</li>
