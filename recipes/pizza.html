    <h1>Pizza</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough 
        topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature, 
        traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package of pizza dough (we use DeLallo! it is THE best.)</li>
        <li>oil for frying (vegetable or canola is best)</li>
        <li>tomato sauce of choice</li>
        <li>fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>fresh basil and/or pesto</li>
        <li>red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>any other toppings you like</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong> Make the pizza dough according to package directions. Let the dough rise
            (for DeLallo pizza dough, the rise time is 45 minutes).</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the dough:</strong> Divide the pizza dough into 6 sections. Roll each into a ball and flatten into a
            pizza shape (mine were about 6-8 inches in diameter and about 1/2 inch thick around the outside).</li>
        <li><strong>Prep the oil:</strong> Heat a large cast iron skillet with oil (about 1 inch deep). Turn the heat to
            medium/low. Test the oil by dropping a speck of water in it â€“ when it sizzles or bubbles,
            then the oil is ready.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the pizza dough:</strong> Working one at a time, gently place the pizzas into the oil and fry for 30
            seconds to 1 minute until light golden brown. Flip with tongs and repeat on the other side.
            Transfer to a paper towel lined pan to cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish in the oven:</strong> Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Spread each pizza with sauce,
            cheese, and any other toppings you want. Bake for 5-10 minutes or until the cheese is melted.
            Top with fresh basil, pesto, or anything else you want and serve warm. And then enjoy those puffy,
            crispy, personal-pan-sized bites of pizza crust! YUMMMMM.</li>
